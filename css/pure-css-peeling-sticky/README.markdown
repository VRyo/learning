# Pure CSS Peeling Sticky
 _A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/patrickkunka/pen/axEgL](https://codepen.io/patrickkunka/pen/axEgL).

 Another experiment into CSS circles I built for a feature on the upcoming www.barrelny.com redesign.

The sticky is made from two seperate circles (front and back), which are moved and masked inversely on :hover (by the circle wrapper elements). A rotation is also applied to mimic realistic motion. Gradients are applied to the front and back to give the illusion of depth.
